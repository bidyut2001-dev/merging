Exporting your data
To maintain access to
 data from your Universal Analytics property,
  you should download or export your data now.
   If this isn’t done through one of the methods
    provided in the Google Analytics Help Center, your data will be permanently deleted by Google and won’t be recoverable. If you intend to use the BigQuery integration to export historical data from your Universal Analytics 360 property, we strongly
 recommend initiating this immediately.
