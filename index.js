Hello Google
 Analytics user,

On July 1, 2024, 
Google Analytics 4 properties will
 have fully replaced Universal Analytics properties, as previously announced. From that date, Google will begin turning off all Universal Analytics services and Universal Analytics APIs, which means Universal Analytics properties will be inaccessible through the Google Analytics front-end and APIs. If you havenâ€™t completely migrated to Google Analytics 4 properties, follow the migration
 guide to start making the switch today.
